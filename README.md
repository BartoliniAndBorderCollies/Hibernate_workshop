This workshop was created to learn and practice Hibernate framework. To see the difference between using JDBC and Hibernate. I was able to understand how Hibernate framework makes life easier through:
- creating tables in database using annotations
- configurational file where I put all configs around database properties (not the whole class needed as in JDBC)
- simplier methods (and shorter) to handle requests to database
